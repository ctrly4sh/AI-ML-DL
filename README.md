My Machine Learning Journey 🚀
Why Just Stick to Full Stack Development or App Development?
Why limit yourself to the same old Full Stack Development or App Development when there's a world of fascinating technologies waiting to be explored?

Exploring the Exciting Realms:
In my quest for knowledge and skill enhancement, I've embarked on a journey into the realms of cutting-edge technologies, including:

Artificial Intelligence 🤖
Machine Learning 🧠
Deep Learning 🌌
Natural Language Processing 🗣️
Neurotechnology 🧠🔬
Image Detection 🖼️

Languages and Resources:

To navigate through this exciting journey, I'm harnessing the power of:
Languages and Tools 🛠️

Python: The versatile language that powers much of the AI and ML world.
JavaScript (maybe): For potential applications in web-based ML projects.

Frameworks:

- TensorFlow
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NLTK
- Spacy
- React
- Node.js
  and more...

Learning Materials:My trusty companion are books:
\*\*\*Will be adding more free books above

"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Géron. (Got the free PDF version! Find it above)

Stay tuned for updates as I navigate through the exciting world of AI, ML, and beyond! 🌟
Peace :)
